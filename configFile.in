#ATTENTION: use absolute paths
##Input
inDir="" #path to rawReads directory containing the raw count data
scriptsDir="" #path to lviProjectDNAScripts
originalSampleDataFile="" #path to csv design file

#Output
acnaDir="" #path to the output directory for CNA variant calls
breakpointDir="" #path to the output directory for breakpoint calls
plotDir="" #path to the output directory for plots
sampleDataFile="" #path to the CSV design file that is generated by CNAcalling.R and used by all downstream analyses

#Other general configuration variables
mc_cores=1 #number of CPU cores you want to use in parallel for some of the analyses

#Genetics
summaryFileName="dataForGenetics.rds" #filename to re-use pre-generated data. By default, it will be generated or expected in $acnaDir

#GISTIC
gisticInputFile="" #path to the input file for GISTIC2.0, which will be generated by makeGisticInputFromTsvFiles.sh
gisticOutDir="" #path to the output directory for GISTIC2.0
gisticMatrixFile="" #path to the refgene matrix distributed with GISTIC2.0: hg38.UCSC.add_miR.160920.refgene.mat
##Alternative analysis
gisticLVIInputFile="" #path to the alternative input file for GISTIC2.0, generated by lviSelection after running makeGisticInputFromTsvFiles.
gisticLVIOutDir="" #path to the output directory of the alternative GISTIC2.0 analysis

#runPhylip
phylipDir="/Applications/phylip/" #path to Phylip's programs
phylipSuffix=".app/Contents/MacOS/" #suffix to add to the program name to find the executable (e.g. $phylipDir/dollop${phylipSuffix}/dollop should point to the dollop executable): MacOS default

#gisticAssociations and deNovoEnrichmentGistic 
gisticLVIOnly=F #logical indicating if the deNovoEnrichmentGistic must be executed with the lvi-only recurrent alterations or all. This does not affect gisticAssociations, which is always done with the results using all input data for GISTIC2.0
